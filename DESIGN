Hierarchy of objects:  environment contains location, which contains
  people and usables.

Easy way to modify objects tentatively -- to create or destroy usables, move
  people around, change attributes of all concerned, et cetera.

Easy way to roll back modifications

Small changes are small in memory -- don't fully copy all states

Easy to explicitly commit changes.  Can choose a "child" state and declare
  it to be the final one, getting rid of all the parents (or just collapsing
  one or more levels?)

Child object should keep track of its root object for versioning.  Root
  object should allow pushing/branching/etc.
